Basic Idea

To solve a problem, solve a subproblem that is a similar instance of the same problem, then use the solution to that
smaller instance to solve the original problem.

Smaller subproblems must arrive at the base case

Rules:
=> Each recursive call should be on a smaller instance of same problem ie smaller subproblem
=> The recursive calls must eventually reach a base case that is solved without further recursion

Improve Efficiency:
We eliminate repeated work by storing results to subproblems:
Dynamic programming: Memoization and Tabulation
