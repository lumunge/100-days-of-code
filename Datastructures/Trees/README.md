### TREES

Hierarchial datastructures
* Root --> Top most node of a tree
* Children --> elements directly under root
* Stores information that might form a hierarchy, ie computer file system
* Moderate Insertion and deletion, access(quicker than linked lists)
* Use cases:
        - manipulate hierarchial data
        - Search information easily
        - router algorithms
        - mulitstage decision making

* Binary tress --> Has at most two children.

            tree
            -----
            root
           /     \
        child1   child2
        /     \
      child3  child4     --> leaves 
      
* Tree Respresentation
    - Data
    - Pointer to left child
    - Pointer to right child
