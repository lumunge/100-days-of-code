# 100 DAYS OF CODE

A repository to keep track of my roadmap to being a more knowledgeable developer

# Why?

I felt lost, without clear direction on where I wanted my career to go. I want to be the best developer I can be, which means I need a roadmap to give me more
structure and a clear picture on where I will be as a developer within the next five years hence my goal is to use this roadmap to guide my learning.

# My inspiration can from this guides:
