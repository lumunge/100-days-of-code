### BACKTRACKING

- Technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally,
  by tyring to build a solution one piece at a time, removing solutions that fail
  to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point during solving the problem.
- Searching every possible combination to slve problem.

#### PROBLEM TYPES:
* Decision problem -> searching for feasible solution
* Optimization problem -> Searching for best solution
* Enumeration problem -> Find all feasible solutions
